= csteamer (content steamer)

* http://github.com/peterc/csteamer

== STATUS:

CSteamer is RIDICULOUSLY EARLY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. IT'S LESS THAN 24 HOURS OLD AND NOT EVEN VAGUELY DONE!! The demo below
will certainly work though ;-)

== DESCRIPTION:

CSteamer extracts metadata and machine-usable data from otherwise unstructured 
HTML documents.

For example, if you have a blog post HTML file, CSteamer should, in theory, be
able to extract the title, the actual "content", images relating to the
content, look up Delicious tags, and analyze for keywords.

== SYNOPSIS:

* Basic demo:

    require 'open-uri'
    require 'csteamer'
    doc = CSteamer::Document.new(open('http://www.rubyinside.com/cramp-asychronous-event-driven-ruby-web-app-framework-2928.html'))
    doc.title   # => "Cramp: Asychronous Event-Driven Ruby Web App Framework"
    doc.author  # => "Peter Cooper"
    doc.lede    # => "CoffeeScript (GitHub repo) is a new programming language with a pure Ruby compiler. Creator Jeremy Ashkenas calls it "JavaScript's less ostentatious kid brother" - mostly because it compiles into JavaScript and shares most of the same constructs, but with a different, tighter syntax."

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
* Send me a pull request.
