  :title: "CoffeeScript: A New Language With A Pure Ruby Compiler"
  :author: Peter Cooper

Creator Jeremy Ashkenas calls it \"JavaScript's less ostentatious kid brother\" - mostly because it compiles into JavaScript and shares most of the same constructs, but with a different, tighter syntax.\nTo get a feel for the language, check out this example code (CoffeeScript on the left, resulting JavaScript on the right):\nAs a Ruby project, you can get the CoffeeScript compiler installed with a simple gem install coffee-script or check out the code from/on GitHub. The code is worth a look as it's notably quite vanilla with hand crafted Ruby covering the lexer and code generation and Racc built code for the parser.\n</div>"
